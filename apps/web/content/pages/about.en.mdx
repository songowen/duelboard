Duelboard is a browser-based **2-player game platform** focused on quick rounds and clear competitive UX.

## What we are building

- Fast-to-learn head-to-head games
- Reusable platform layer for adding new games
- Consistent UI patterns across solo AI and online 1v1 modes

## Architecture principles

1. Routing stays in `app/`.
2. Game logic and containers stay in `components/games/{slug}`.
3. Shared primitives (layout, buttons, tooltip, i18n utilities) stay in `components/game-core`.
4. Game availability is controlled by a typed registry.

## Why this matters

This structure keeps gameplay contracts stable while making content, SEO, and page-level UX easier to iterate.
