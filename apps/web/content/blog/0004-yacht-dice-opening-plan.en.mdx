If your first turns are unstable, the whole match gets harder. This opening plan keeps your score curve smooth.

## Opening target

- Turn 1: prioritize stable value (upper section or Choice)
- Turn 2: branch into setup categories only if probability is real
- Turn 3: avoid zero unless it protects a stronger endgame line

## Fast decision rule

1. If you can lock a reliable score now, take it.
2. If the board is behind and setup is good, take one calculated risk.
3. Do not force Yacht too early without support dice.

## Why this works in 1v1

Short matches punish low floors more than they reward flashy highs.  
A stable opening keeps pressure on your rival and gives flexibility for late categories.
