If this is your first Yacht Dice match, focus on **turn flow** before advanced strategy.

## Turn flow in plain terms

1. Roll all five dice.
2. Keep useful dice by holding them.
3. Reroll the rest.
4. Do this up to three rolls.
5. Lock one category score.

## Common beginner mistakes

- Scoring too early after roll #1
- Over-chasing Yacht every turn
- Ignoring safe categories in the upper section

## Rule reminder

You cannot submit a score before making at least one roll in that turn.
