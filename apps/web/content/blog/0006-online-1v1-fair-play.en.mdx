Good online matches are not only about winning. They are about smooth flow, fairness, and clear communication.

## Before match

- Confirm stable network
- Check room link and mode
- Set your nickname clearly

## During match

- Avoid tab spam and accidental refresh
- Respect turn flow and timing
- If lag appears, wait briefly before repeating actions

## After match

- Use rematch intentionally
- If you must leave, do it quickly and clearly
- Report reproducible bugs with steps and device/browser info

Better match quality improves player trust and session retention, which also helps platform growth.
