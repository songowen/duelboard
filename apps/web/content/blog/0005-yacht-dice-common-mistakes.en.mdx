Most losses are not bad luck. They are repeated decision patterns. Fix these first.

## Mistake 1: locking too early

If rolls remain and your board still has flexible targets, avoid locking low value immediately.

## Mistake 2: all-in on Yacht every turn

Yacht is high reward but high variance. Chase it only when setup dice actually support it.

## Mistake 3: ignoring board state

Your best move depends on score gap, not only on this roll.

## Mistake 4: weak zero placement

A bad zero now can block multiple endgame routes later.

## Mistake 5: panic after one bad turn

One low turn does not end the game. Rebuild using stable categories and pressure timing.
