In 1v1 matches, strategy is often about **risk timing**, not only peak score.

## Practical plan

1. Secure stable categories early.
2. Chase high-variance outcomes only with real setup probability.
3. Use aggressive scoring mainly when trailing.

## Endgame tip

Always evaluate remaining category flexibility, not just this turn's best-looking number.
