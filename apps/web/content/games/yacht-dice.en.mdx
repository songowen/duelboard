Yacht Dice is a quick **roll-hold-score** game for short head-to-head sessions.

## Core rules

1. Roll 5 dice.
2. Hold selected dice.
3. Reroll the rest (up to 3 total rolls per turn).
4. Lock one category score.
5. Fill all categories and compare total score.

## Scoring categories

- Ones to Sixes: sum of matching faces
- Choice: sum of all five dice
- Four of a Kind: score when four+ faces match
- Full House: score for 3+2 pattern
- Small Straight: 4-step sequence
- Large Straight: 5-step sequence
- Yacht: five of a kind (highest category)

## FAQ

### Can I score before rolling?
No. You need at least one roll in a turn.

### Can I take zero points?
Yes. Taking zero strategically can improve endgame flexibility.

### What keeps online matches fair?
Turn/version checks and server-authoritative updates help prevent out-of-order move acceptance.

## Accessibility and mobile tips

- On smaller screens, review score rows with vertical scrolling.
- Decide hold targets before roll #2 to reduce input mistakes.
- Use US/KR toggle to switch category explanation language instantly.
